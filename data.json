      "Book 5 - Athena encourages Diomedes": "But the goddess roused him on, her eyes blazing:\n\"True son of Tydeus, Diomedes, joy of my heart!\nForget the orders\u2014nothing to fear, my friend, neither Ares nor any other god. You too,\nI'll urge you on with so much winning force. Up now! Lash your racing horses at Ares first,\nstrike him at close range, no shrinking away here\nbefore that headlong Ares! Just look at the manic,\nborn for disaster, double-dealing, lying two-face god\u2014\njust now he promised me and Hera, the War-god swore\nhe'd fight the Trojans, stand behind the Argives.\nBut now, look, he's leading the Trojan rampage,\nhis pledges thrown to the winds!",
      "Book 6 - Leaves": "Like the generations of leaves, the lives of mortal men.\nNow the wind scatters the old leaves across the earth,\nnow the living timber bursts with the new buds\nand spring comes round again. And so with men:\nas one generation comes to life, another dies away.",
      "Book 9 - Glory or long life": "If I hold out here and I lay siege to Troy,\nmy journey home is gone, but my glory never dies.\nIf I voyage back to the fatherland I love,\nmy pride, my glory dies . . .\ntrue, but the life that's left me will be long,\nthe stroke of death will not come on me quickly.",
      "Book 21 - Moaning about death": "Come, friend, you too must die. Why moan about it so?\nEven Patroclus died, a far, far better man than you.\nAnd look, you see how handsome and powerful I am?\nThe son of a great man, the mother who gave me life\na deathless goddess. But even for me, I tell you,\ndeath and the strong force of fate are waiting."

      "Book 5 - Athena encourages Diomedes": "Then in turn the goddess grey-eyed Athene answered him:\n'Son of Tydeus, you who delight my heart, Diomedes,\nno longer be thus afraid of Ares, nor of any other\nimmortal; such a helper shall I be standing beside you.\nCome then, first against Ares steer your single-foot horses,\nand strike him from close. Be not afraid of violent Ares,\nthat thing of fury, evil-wrought, that double-faced liar\nwho even now protested to Hera and me, promising\nthat he would fight against the Trojans and stand by the Argives.\nNow, all promises forgotten, he stands by the Trojans.'",
      "Book 6 - Leaves": "As is the generation of leaves, so is that of humanity.\nThe wind scatters the leaves on the ground, but the live timber\nburgeons with leaves again in the season of spring returning.\nSo one generation of men will grow while another\ndies.",
      "Book 9 - Glory or long life": "I carry two sorts of destiny toward the day of my death. Either,\nif I stay here and fight beside the city of the Trojans,\nmy return home is gone, but my glory shall be everlasting;\nbut if I return home to the beloved land of my fathers,\nthe excellence of my glory is gone, but there will be a long life\nleft for me, and my end in death will not come to me quickly.",

Why all this clamour about it?\nPatroklos also is dead, who was better by far than you are.\nDo you not see what a man I am, how huge, how splendid\nand born of a great father, and the mother who bore me immortal?\nYet even I have also my death and my strong destiny"
